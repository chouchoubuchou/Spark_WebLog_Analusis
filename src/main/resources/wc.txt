I prefer movies
I prefer cats
I prefer the oaks along the Warta
I prefer Dickens to Dostoyevsky
I prefer myself liking people
to myself loving mankind
I prefer keeping a needle and thread on hand, just in case
I prefer the color green
I prefer not to maintain
that reason is to blame for everything
I prefer exceptions
I prefer to leave early
I prefer talking to doctors about something else
I prefer the old fine-lined illustrations
I prefer the absurdity of writing poems
to the absurdity of not writing poems
I prefer, where love's concerned, nonspecific anniversaries
that can be celebrated every day
I prefer moralists
who promise me nothing
I prefer cunning kindness to the over-trustful kind
I prefer the earth in civvies
I prefer conquered to conquering countries
I prefer having some reservations
I prefer the hell of chaos to the hell of order
I prefer Grimms' fairy tales to the newspapers' front pages
I prefer leaves without flowers to flowers without leaves
I prefer dogs with uncropped tails
I prefer light eyes, since mine are dark
I prefer desk drawers
I prefer many things that I haven't mentioned here
to many things I've also left unsaid
I prefer zeroes on the loose
to those lined up behind a cipher
I prefer the time of insects to the time of stars
I prefer to knock on wood
I prefer not to ask how much longer and when
I prefer keeping in mind even the possibility
that existence has its own reason for being.
